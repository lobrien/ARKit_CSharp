# ARKit_CSharp

Minimal ARKit demo in C#

The program initializes an ARKit session. When a horizontal plane is detected, a small red cube is placed at the “anchor point”. 

Once at least 1 horizontal plane has been detected, the user can  tap on the screen and, if the selected point intersects a plane, a cube is placed at that location.
